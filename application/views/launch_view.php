<h1>Hello!</h1>
<section id="splash">
	<p>Welcome to Tapedock, a delightful new way to share your music with your friends. Once you've signed up and signed into your account, you can find your friends (or make new ones) and begin sharing your taste in music with them by creating your own digital mixtapes from your music library. Just like your old cassette deck, but without the brushed chrome finish.</p>
